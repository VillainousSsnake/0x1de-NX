# 0x1de-NX
### DESCRIPTION:
0x1de NX is a modding tool for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom modders that aims to make modding and playing/managing mods as simple and easy as possible. It is being developed by me (VillainousSsnake) a Tears of the Kingdom who had the idea when I was tediously merging and editing RESTBL files. But 0x1de-NX will do way more than merge files.

### LATEST VERSION: 
None (0.0.1 releasing mid-2024)

### Planned Features:
- **Mesh editor** for **MeshCodec Packages** (.mc files)
- **File Format Editor** for **all *Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* File Formats**
- **Mod Merger** so you can **Merge *Any* Mods**

### Please join the discord!
Joining the discord will help support the project, and you would get anouncements about 0x1de-NX early! Please join the discord! When a new person joins, it shows that people actually care about these types of tools. And who knows, maybe I'll give an early release only to discord members... (\*Forshadowing\*)
