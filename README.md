# 0x1de-NX
### DESCRIPTION:
0x1de NX is a modding tool for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom modders that aims to make modding and playing/managing mods as simple and easy as possible. It is being developed by me (VillainousSsnake) a Tears of the Kingdom modder who had the idea when I was tediously merging and editing RESTBL files. But 0x1de-NX will do way more than merge files.

### LATEST VERSION: 
None (0.0.1 releasing mid-2024)

### Planned Features:
- **Mesh editor** for **MeshCodec Packages** (.mc files)
- **File Format Editor** for **all *Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* File Formats**
- **Mod Merger** so you can **Merge *Any* Mods**
- **Terrain and Map Editor** so you can create **Terrain and Map mods**
