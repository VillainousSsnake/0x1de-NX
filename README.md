# 0x1de-NX

## NOTICE:
Please note that there are currently no releases for this app. 0x1de-NX is still in development. However, the source code is avalible to the public through this repository. If you want to install Python 3.11 and run the project yourself, dont expect any of the features to work or even be implemented though. If you do plan to run the application, see "Installation and Setup (From Source Code)" to do so.

### LATEST VERSION: 
0.0.1

### DESCRIPTION:
0x1de NX is a modding tool for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom modders that aims to make modding and playing/managing mods as simple and easy as possible. It is being developed by me (VillainousSsnake) a Tears of the Kingdom who had the idea when I was tediously merging and editing RESTBL files. But 0x1de-NX will do way more than merge files.

### Planned Features:
- **Mesh editor** for **MeshCodec Packages** (.mc files)
- **File Format Editor** for **all *Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* File Formats**
- **Mod Merger** so you can **Merge *Any* Mods**

### Please join the discord!
Joining the discord will help support the project, and you would get anouncements about 0x1de-NX early! Please join the discord! When a new person joins, it shows that people actually care about these types of tools. And who knows, maybe I'll give an early release only to discord members... (\*Forshadowing\*)
