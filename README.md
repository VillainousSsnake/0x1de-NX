# 0x1de-NX
### DESCRIPTION:
0x1de NX is a modding tool for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom modders that aims to make modding and playing/managing mods as simple and easy as possible. It is being developed by me (VillainousSsnake) a Tears of the Kingdom who had the idea when I was tediously merging and editing RESTBL files. But 0x1de-NX will do way more than merge files.

0x1de NX is split into 3 parts, and then near the end of development when all the parts are finished with development, they will be combined into 0x1de NX.

Here are the links to the GitHub Pages to each part.
- Part 1 - TotkModLauncher (TML): https://github.com/VillainousSsnake/TotkModLauncher
- Part 2 - TotkMeshCodecEditor: https://github.com/VillainousSsnake/p0lyg0n
- Part 3 - TotkRomfsFileEditor (TRFE): https://github.com/VillainousSsnake/TotkRomfsFileEditor
- Part 4 - TotkTerrain(And)MapEditor (TTME): https://github.com/VillainousSsnake/TotkTerrainAndMapEditor
